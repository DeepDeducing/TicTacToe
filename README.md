# Deep Deducing on Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains codes illustrating how deep deducing plays Tic Tac Toe.
To reproduce the results in the paper, simply run Deducing.py

The codes are little bit ... awkward ... because we hand-coded it in a very primitive early stage.
Please accept our apology.


## Requirements
